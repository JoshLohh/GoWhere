**AI Hangout Route Planner**

A hackathon MVP that helps you figure out what to do today — instantly.

🚀 Project Overview

Planning a day out in Singapore can be a hassle — jumping between Google Maps, Instagram, TikTok, and reviews just to find good spots that are walkable and nearby.

This app lets a user:

* Select their vibe (chill, food crawl, date, trendy, etc.)

* Input starting location and time available

…and it generates a 3-stop route with:

Cafes, restaurants, and activities

Map visualization with a walkable/drivable route

AI explanations for why each stop fits the vibe

Think of it as a smart, one-click planner for your day.
